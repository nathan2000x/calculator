Until we’ll set the meeting (me and my brother), he can learn to write modern web development code and tools.

- Implement Window’s calculator that looks and behaves similarly.
- Start with the basic functionality (press with mouse and type with keyboard on basic math actions), then progress to a more advanced functionality (memory, scientific buttons, parentheses, themes, user login with google, save history per user in DB, etc)
- Each step you progress, make sure it works properly, including unit tests (using jest) and CI using GitHub CI configurations and Vercel’s CD.
- Use GitHub to store your code. Define GitHub CI configuration file to run on each commit (npm install, test and built) and use Pull Requests to push your code to ‘dev’ branch while you develop features and ‘dev’ to ‘main’ branch when you ready to release (never push code directly to main and dev branches). Make the repository public and invite me (slavikme@gmail.com) to the repo to be a reviewer.
- Use Vercel to deploy your code and make it available online.
- Use Next.js with TypeScript to write your code (you need to learn the basics of React first).
- Install Cursor AI IDE to help you coding.
